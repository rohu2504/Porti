    <p class="c">MISLEADING INFORMATION DETECTOR</p>
    <p class="d">Misleading Information Detector was a comprehensive machine learning project I undertook over a 6 month
        duration
        to build and deploy a practical tool for identifying unreliable or fake news content. I had conceived the idea
        after realizing how social media and other online mediums have enabled the rampant spread of misinformation in
        recent times.

        As the sole developer, my first task involved extensive research of academic papers around fake news detection
        using natural language processing and neural network algorithms. This study equipped me with the knowledge of
        how manipulative writing exhibits certain linguistic patterns that can be computationally decoded. Based on
        these insights, I decided to train a linear Support Vector Machine model for accurate classification potential.

        My model development process entailed data collection, text preprocessing, vectorization and hyperparameter
        tuning phases before satisfactory accuracy measures were attained. I used Python ecosystem tools like Pandas,
        Scikit-Learn and NLTK to execute the model building cycle. Once confident in real world performance, I
        architected and coded a web interface allowing user text inputs and displaying visual highlights on potentially
        misleading snippets.
        Hosting the application online provided me the opportunity to test it across diverse use cases of news articles.
        Iteratively enhancing the user experience and interpretation of model outputs was pivotal in making an abstract
        research project into an impactful solution. Seeing positive user feedback first-hand truly validated the
        societal value that AI technology can enable when applied judiciously.

    <p class="e">SYSTEM TO RECOGNIZE ALERT AND WELCOME</p>
    <p class="f">
        Here is a 300 word description of your 'System to Recognize Alert and Welcome' project:

        System to Recognize Alert and Welcome was a 4 month deep learning project where I developed an application for
        automated visitor identification paired with customized voice outputs. The motivation stemmed from wanting to
        explore advanced computer vision and audio processing methods beyond textbook concepts.

        I began by studying state-of-the-art facial recognition algorithms to identify deep neural network architectures
        that could achieve over 95% accuracy for my use case. After experimenting with models like VGGFace and FaceNet,
        I fine-tuned a ResNet network on a labeled dataset of human faces. For reliable recognition, I trained the model
        on NVIDIA GPU infrastructure to speed up iterations.

        With a performant face detection backend in place, I focused on building a customizable audio response system
        triggered by recognition events. Using Python speech libraries, I enabled text-to-speech conversion with
        personalized voice outputs like "Welcome John!" based on identified visitors. Alert notifications could also be
        automatically dispatched to authorized personnel.

        By the end of development, I had an integrated application that could accurately identify people entering a
        premises and play appropriate pre-recorded messages. The system could seamlessly switch between multiple
        language options as well for wider applicability. I was able to demo the working prototype to generally positive
        feedback at my university's project exhibition.

        Leading this deep learning project from vision to voice augmented my hands-on understanding of convolutional
        neural networks for image classification, training strategies for accuracy improvements, and integration of
        machine learning components into full-fledged products. It also strengthened my intuition around responsibly
        deploying AI technology by deliberately accounting for risks like data or algorithmic bias.
